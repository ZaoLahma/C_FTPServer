# C_FTPServer
A very simple FTP server written in C for *nix systems

It has support for the basic file operations (store, retrieve, create, delete) as well as rudimentary support for multiple
users (will be extended eventually).

This is in no way a production level FTP server implementation and should not be used as such.
